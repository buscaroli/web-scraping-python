Create a virtual environment to store your code if using large dependencies
like scrapy.
The virtual environment is excluded from git thanks to .gitignore (just add
venv/ inside it or the name you have chosen for the virtual environment),
and also note  you don't need to store the projects insode the venv directory,
in fact you can store them anywhere as long as you activate the appropriate
venv.
It's good practice to save a file with the list of the dependencies, you can do
it in two ways:
1.  Create a requirements.txt file by using the following command:
        pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
    Those dependencies can be installed with:
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
2.  Alternatively the requirements.txt file can also be created with:
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
